# Substrate snap for MetaMask

 A MetaMask snap for seamless interaction with the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem, a prominent platform for cross-chain communication and scalability. Now you can use your MetaMask wallet to access Polkadot/Substrate dApps and tokens effortlessly.

To integrate this Snap into your dApp, you can easily upgrade your existing @polkadot/extension-dapp by replacing it with @polkadot/extension-dapp. It's important to note that once our changes are merged into the official polkadot extension-dapp, this manual update will no longer be necessary.
